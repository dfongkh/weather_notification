Weather notification 

This idea came up when I was thinking of how do I get a simple notification about the temperature at a specific time on my mobile or watch

This app uses the API from the HK Observatory, takes the data retrieved and send an email. A notification will pop up as a new email. 

This app simply runs on your local machine, uses ngrok to create a public URLÂ for Invictify to run the app on a schedule.
